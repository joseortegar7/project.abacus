## Description

This is more than just a simple calculator. It's a complete web application that includes advanced UI/UX features designed to provide a smooth and satisfying user experience. The entire application was built from the ground up, focusing on clean code, modern web standards, and maintainability. It is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

## Features

This calculator comes packed with a wide range of features:

* **Core Arithmetic:** Standard operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
* **Animated Theme Switcher:** A beautiful, animated toggle switch to seamlessly transition between a light and dark theme.
* **Calculation History:** Automatically saves the last 20 calculations.
* **History Viewer:** A pop-up modal to view the complete calculation history.
* **Copy to Clipboard:**
    * Copy any calculation from the history list.
    * Copy the currently displayed result directly from the screen.
* **Responsive Display:** The font size of the display dynamically adjusts to fit long numbers.
* **Intelligent Formatting:**
    * Adds comma separators for large numbers to improve readability.
    * Automatically formats very large numbers into scientific notation.
* **Mobile Responsive Design:** The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes for optimal viewing and usability on phones, tablets, and desktops.
* **Polished UI/UX:**

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic and accessible elements.
* **CSS3:** Styled with modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and includes smooth transitions, animations, and media queries for responsiveness.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** All calculator logic is encapsulated in a clean, object-oriented `Calculator` class. No external libraries or frameworks were used.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Ensure all project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `index.js`) are in the same folder.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

For the best development experience (with live reloading), you can use the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.
